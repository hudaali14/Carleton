<p class="segment-header">Description</p>
<p>The purpose of this exercise is to make sure you understand some important concepts about java objects, classes and inheritance. You will need to know these concepts very well to use java to build android apps.</p>
<p>We will build and run simple java programs outside the android environment. This will allow us to do simple java experiments when learning the java programming language and object-oriented programming.</p>
<p class="red">You need to demonstrate your exercise to the TA or Prof. before you leave the class to get credit for it. If you complete, or make significant progress on the exercise you will get a mark of 2. If you make some progress you will get a mark of 1 and can &quot;upgrade&quot; that mark to a 2 by showing your completed work within one week of this exercise. 0 marks for a no-show or unsufficient progress.</p>

<p class="segment-header">Preliminary: A Simple Java Program</p>
<p>Create an empty folder somewhere on your machine and open a terminal window at that location. Verify the versions of java and javac by executing <span class="code">java -version</span> and <span class="code">javac -version</span>:</p>
<p><img src="images/stepP2-1.png" width="846" height="194" alt=""/></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do not have a javac compiler or a java runtime version then first follow the instructions in <span class="black-bold">notes 03 Installing Java JDK</span>. You can use any version of java JDK 8 or higher (You might have a later version installed from COMP 1006/1406 which will be fine.)</p>
<p>From this point we will assume you have a java JDK installed.</p>
<p>Create two files <span class="code">MyApp.java</span> and <span class="code">Song.java</span> by executing <span class="code">touch MyApp.java</span> and <span class="code">touch Song.java</span> (<span class="code">touch</span> is a linux terminal command that changes the timestamp of a file and also creates the file if it does not already exist). List the files in the directory (folder) by executing <span class="code">ls</span>.</p>
<p><img src="images/stepP2-2.png" alt="test"/></p>
<p>Open <span class="code">MyApp.java</span> with your favourite text editor (TextEdit on the Mac is fine) and type the following code. <span class="red">(You should actually type it rather than cut and paste as you will learn more about java that way.)</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<pre>
class MyApp {
   public static void main(String[] args){
      System.out.println("Hello World");

      Song song = new Song("Girl From Ipanema", "***");
      System.out.println("Song: " + song.getTitle() + " rating: " + song.getRating());
      song.setRating("*****");
      System.out.println("Song: " + song.getTitle() + " rating: " + song.getRating());
   }
}
</pre>
	<p>Add the following code to <span class="code">Song.java</span>:</p>
<pre>
public class Song{
   
   //represents a song
   private String title;  //title of the song
   private String rating; //"*" ... "*****"

   //constructor
   public Song(String aSongTitle, String aRating){
      title = aSongTitle;
      rating = aRating;
   }
   //get and set methods
   public String getTitle(){return title;}
   public String getRating(){return rating;}
   public void setRating(String aRating){
       rating = aRating;
   }
}
	</pre>
	<p>
	To compile the code execute <span class="code">javac MyApp.java</span>. You might get errors which you should try to debug and fix. Keep fixing and compiling until you have a "clean compile". At this stage two more files will have been created: <span class="code">MyApp.class</span> and <span class="code">Song.class</span>. These are the compiled versions of the source code you wrote.</p>
	<p><img src="images/stepP2-3.png" alt="test"/></p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>To run the program execute <span class="code">java MyApp</span></p>
	<p><img src="images/stepP2-4.png" alt=""/></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<p class="segment-header">Problem1: Object Attributes</p>
<p>Modify the <span class="code">Song</span> class to add a <span class="code">String composer</span> property and make whatever other changes are required in the <span class="code">Song</span> class to support this.</p>
<p>Modify the <span class="code">main</span> method in <span class="code">MyApp</span> to create two songs and then print them as follows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre>
public class MyApp {
   public static void main(String[] args){
      System.out.println("Hello World");

      Song song1 = new Song("Girl From Ipanema", "Antonio Carlos Jobim", "*****");
      Song song2 = new Song("Hotel California", "Don Henley Glenn Frey Don Felder", "****");
      System.out.println("Song: " + song1.getTitle() + " by " + song1.getComposer() + " rating: " + song1.getRating());
      System.out.println("Song: " + song2.getTitle() + " by " + song2.getComposer() + " rating: " + song2.getRating());
   }
}
	</pre>
<p>Run the app; the output should look like the the following:</p>
<p><img src="images/problem1-1.png" width="903" height="135" alt=""/></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<p class="segment-header">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="segment-header">Problem 2: Ask Not What I Can Do For This Object...</p>
<p>Notice in the previous <span class="code">main</span> program it has to figure out how to print the details of a song and then do that for each song. It is generally preferred in object-oriented programing to have objects do things for themselves. </p>
<p>Modify the code so that the main method can simply ask each object to print itself. This will require you to add a <span class="code">public void print()</span> method to the <span class="code">Song</span> class.</p>
<p>The main routine should now looks as follows and the output should be as before.</p>
	<pre>
public class MyApp {
   public static void main(String[] args){
      System.out.println("Hello World");

      Song song1 = new Song("Girl From Ipanema", "Antonio Carlos Jobim", "*****");
      Song song2 = new Song("Hotel California", "Don Henley Glenn Frey Don Felder", "****");
      song1.print();
      song2.print();
   }
}
	</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
	
<p class="segment-header">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="segment-header">Problem 3: Collection of Songs</p>
<p>Modify the <span class="code">main</span> method so that instead of having individual song variables it maintains an <span class="code">ArrayList&lt;Song&gt;</span> songs collection. To learn about java's ArrayList&lt;&gt; class look at the JavaAPI documentation at <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/</a></p>
<p><img src="images/problem3-1.png" width="1082" height="752" alt=""/></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre>
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class MyApp {
   public static void main(String[] args){

      ArrayList&lt;Song&gt; songs = new ArrayList&lt;Song&gt;();

      songs.add(new Song("Girl From Ipanema", "Antonio Carlos Jobim", "*****"));
      songs.add(new Song("Hotel California", "Don Henley Glenn Frey Don Felder", "****"));

      System.out.println("Songs:");
      for(Song s : songs) {
        s.print();
      }
      
   }
}
	</pre>
<p>Notice the following: </p>
<p>1) There is now an <span class="code">import</span> statement in <span class="code">MyApp.java</span> to make the<span class="code"> ArrayList</span> class available. How did I know from the documentation what to import?</p>
<p>2) Notice the &quot;for-each&quot; loop that iterates over the ArrayList container.</p>
<p>The output should now look like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/problem3-2.png" width="883" height="160" alt=""/></p>

<p class="segment-header">Problem 4: Inheritance -A Song Subclass</p>
<p>Now imagine that a <span class="code">RecordedSong</span> is like a <span class="code">Song</span> but it has been recorded by an <span class="code">artist</span> (performer)  and the audio represented by a particular .mp3 file. Create a new file <span class="code">RecordedSong.java</span> which defines a class <span class="code">RecordedSong</span> that <span class="black-bold">inherits from</span> (or <span class="code">extends</span>) <span class="code">Song</span>.</p>
<p>Also we want to associate the <span class="code">rating</span> with the <span class="code">RecordedSong</span> not the <span class="code">Song</span> it inherits from. Remove the <span class="code">rating</span> attribute from <span class="code">Song</span> and move it to <span class="code">RecordedSong</span>.</p>
<p>The <span class="code">RecordedSong</span> class should look something like the following (make the required changes in the <span class="black-bold">superclass</span> <span class="code">Song</span> to make this work): Notice we are now using <span class="code">System.out.print()</span> instead of <span class="code">System.out.println()</span> so we can control when the next line starts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre>
public class RecordedSong extends Song{
   
   //represents a song
   private String artist;  //performer
   private String mp3Filename;
   private String rating; //"*" ... "*****"

   //constructor
   public RecordedSong(String aSongTitle, String aComposer, String anArtist, String anMp3Filename, String aRating){
      super(aSongTitle, aComposer);
      artist = anArtist;
      mp3Filename = anMp3Filename;
      rating = aRating;
   }
   //get and set methods
   public String getArtist(){return artist;}
   public String getMP3Filename(){return mp3Filename;}
   public String getRating(){return rating;}
   public void setRating(String aRating){
       rating = aRating;
   }
   public void print(){
     super.print();
     System.out.print(" artist: " + artist + " mp3: " + mp3Filename + " rating: " + rating);
     System.out.println("");
   }
}
	</pre>
<p>The <span class="code">main</span> routine should now look as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre>
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class MyApp {
   public static void main(String[] args){

      ArrayList&lt;RecordedSong&gt; songs = new ArrayList&lt;RecordedSong&gt;();

      songs.add(new RecordedSong("Girl From Ipanema", "Antonio Carlos Jobim", "Stan Getz", "file1.mp3",  "*****"));
      songs.add(new RecordedSong("Hotel California", "Don Henley Glenn Frey Don Felder", "Eagles", "hotel_california.mp3", "****"));

      System.out.println("Songs:");
      for(Song s : songs) {
        s.print();
      }
      
   }
}
	</pre>
<p>When you've got the code sorted out the output should look like the following:</p>
<p><img src="images/problem4-1.png" width="1375" height="162" alt=""/></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<p class="segment-header">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="segment-header">Problem 5: Superclass Variables Refering To Subclass Objects</p>
<p>Change the statement in the MyApp.java:</p>
<pre>
ArrayList&lt;RecordedSong&gt; songs = new ArrayList&lt;RecordedSong&gt;();
</pre>
<p>to the following instead:</p>
<pre>
ArrayList&lt;Song&gt; songs = new ArrayList&lt;Song&gt;();
</pre>
<p>but leave the other statements the same. Compile an run the program and verify that it still behaves the same. The effect is that you have declared a collection of <span class="code">Song</span> objects but you have put <span class="code">RecordedSong</span> instances into that collection. Why is that OK?</p>
<p>This is a very common programming pattern in object-oriented programming. That is, putting subclass objects into a container that is declared to hold superclass objects. This pattern is used a lot in android applications. Why do you think it is desirable?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In doing these problems it's very important that you understand the java that has been used and the consequences of using inheritance. Ask lots of questions about this. Almost all java application classes that you will build in Android will involve inheritance. You will not get far if these concepts   are not  clear to you.</p>
<p><span class="red">When you have completed these problems demonstrate your code to  the TA or Prof. to get credit for the tutorial.</span> </p>
