<p class="segment-header">Description:</p>
<p>The purpose of this exercise is to learn how state information can be saved and restored when android activities are destroyed and later recreated. This is an integral part of the android activity lifecyle. Using this technique we will solve the screen rotation problem observed in the last tutorial.</p>
<p class="red">You need to demonstrate your exercise to the TA or Prof. before you leave the class to get credit for it. Marks: 2 or completion, 1 for partial progress, 0 for no show or no progress. (A mark of 1 can be upgraded to 2 is show us your completed work within one week of this exercise.)</p>

<p class="segment-header"><span class="black-bold">Background:</span></p>
<p><span class="black-bold">Acitivties</span> in android go through a lifecycle as a result of having lifecyle methods invoked on them by the android operating system. Methods such as <span class="code">onCreate()</span>, <span class="code">onPause()</span>, <span class="code">onResume()</span> etc. The  lifecycle of <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/index.html"><span class="code">Activity</span></a> instances is described <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/activity-lifecycle.html">here</a> and a picture of the life cycle is as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/lifecycle.png" width="688" height="302" alt=""/></p>
<p>In addition a <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Bundle.html"><span class="code">Bundle</span></a> <span class="code">savedInstanceState</span> often accompanies these methods which allows the activities to save their state when being paused, or stopped, and recover their state when being resumed. In this tutorial we will make use of this lifecyle method.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="segment-header"><span class="black-bold">Demo Code</span></p>
<p>For this tutorial use your answer code from the previous tutorial on Activity Lifecyles. Run your app and perform the screen rotation scenario:</p>
<p class="segment-header">Screen Rotation Scenario (from previous tutorial)</p>
<p>Clear the logcat, run the app from Android Studio. Answer a couple of quiz questions then rotate the device screen from portrait to landscape and then back to portrait. What do you observe about the app behaviour. Explain the logcat output that results. How many actual activities are involved?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/prelim1-1.png" width="254" height="391" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/prelim1-2.png" width="430" height="229" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/prelim1-3.png" width="219" height="402" alt=""/></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This scenario reveals a significant problem.  The questions reset to the start. What explanation did the logcat provide about why this is happening. In this tutorial we will build a solution for this problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<p class="segment-header">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="segment-header">Problem 1 Logcat setup</p>
<p>For problem 1 we will investigate another important lifecycle method. It is not a true lifecycle method in that it doesn't indicate you are moving to a new state but it is called when certain lifecyle state transistions happen.</p>
<p>To learn about this read the android documentation associated with the lifecyle (look for the section called <span class="black-bold">Saving and Restoring Activity State</span>) <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/activity-lifecycle.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>In the main activity override the <span class="code">onSaveInstancesState(Bundle)</span> method:</p>
<pre>@Override<br>public&#32;void&#32;onSaveInstanceState(Bundle&#32;savedInstanceState)&#32;{<br><br>&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;//&#32;Always&#32;call&#32;the&#32;superclass&#32;so&#32;it&#32;can&#32;save&#32;the&#32;view&#32;hierarchy&#32;state<br>&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;super.onSaveInstanceState(savedInstanceState);<br>&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;Log.i(TAG,&#32;"onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)");<br>}</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Run the app and go through some of the scenarios from the last tutorial including the rotation scenario. Find out when this method is being called. Does it happen on particular state transitions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="segment-header">Problem 2 Bundles</p>
<p>Android provides a mechanism to store the state of an activity when it moves to the <span class="black-bold">stopped</span> lifecyle state. The state variables of the activity are put in a data structure of type <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Bundle.html"><span class="code">Bundle</span></a>. Read the documentation on <span class="code">Bundle</span>. It is a Key-Value pair collection that can store specific primitive types. In particular locate in the documentation the put method:</p>
<p><img src="images/problem1-1.png" width="861" height="62" alt=""/></p>
<p>and the get methods:</p>
<p><img src="images/problem1-2.png" width="978" height="159" alt=""/></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are examples of the kinds of methods used to put and retrieve simple (primitive) items from a <span class="code">Bundle</span>.</p>
<p>When an activity is destroyed by, for example, the user pressing the back button or by rotating the device the activity's data that android knows about is stored in a <span class="code">Bundle</span> object. If a new activity of the same kind is created it is passed that <span class="code">Bundle</span> object which is then used to initialize the activity. Unfortunately the bundle does not carry our information about what quiz question the user was on.</p>
<p>The idea is to &quot;piggyback&quot; our application's state information on that bundle object. That is, when the state is being saved we can put our current quiz question index into the bundle and when a new activity of the same type is being created we can read the question index out of the bundle.</p>
<p>Create a <span class="code">static String</span> constant to act as the bundle item key (can you figure out why it needs to be <span class="code">static</span>?):</p>
<pre>private&#32;static&#32;String&#32;QUESTION_INDEX_KEY&#32;=&#32;"question_index";</pre>
<p>In the <span class="code">onSaveInstanceState()</span> method write the app's quiz question index to the bundle object.</p>
	<pre>@Override<br>public&#32;void&#32;onSaveInstanceState(Bundle&#32;savedInstanceState)&#32;{<br><br>&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;//&#32;Always&#32;call&#32;the&#32;superclass&#32;so&#32;it&#32;can&#32;save&#32;the&#32;view&#32;hierarchy&#32;state<br>&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;super.onSaveInstanceState(savedInstanceState);<br>&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;savedInstanceState.putInt(QUESTION_INDEX_KEY,&#32;mCurrentQuestionIndex);<br>&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;Log.i(TAG,&#32;"onSaveInstanceState(Bundle)");<br>}</pre>
<p>In the <span class="code">onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState)</span> method read the question index out of the bundle that is passed in. Note this code must check for the possiblity that there is no saved state information. That is, check that <span class="code">saveInstanceState</span> is not, in fact, <span class="code">null</span>:</p>
<pre>if(savedInstanceState&#32;!=&#32;null)<br>&#32;&#32;&#32;&#32;mCurrentQuestionIndex&#32;=&#32;savedInstanceState.getInt(QUESTION_INDEX_KEY,&#32;0);<br>
</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rerun the app and go through the rotation use case. You should observe that the application now remembers which question the user was on.</p>
<p><img src="images/problem2-1.png" width="219" height="401" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/problem2-2.png" width="390" height="230" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/problem2-3.png" width="219" height="401" alt=""/></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on this you now have a way to store arbitrary information to be restored when a destroyed app gets recreated. Be aware though that this mechanism is meant for small amount of primitive data. It is not meant to carry a large payload or use complex (java object) data types.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class="segment-header">Problem 3</p>
<p class="red">[Note this section is from winter 2018, API level 26 please let us know if your experience is much different.]</p>
<p>Now that your app can survive a screen rotation it opens up the possiblity of designing a different layout for the landscape orientation. Many apps are easier to use if the portrait and landscape layouts are specific to those orientations.</p>
<p>Right click on the res category in the Android project view and choose <span class="black-bold">res-&gt;New-&gt;Android Resource Directory</span>:</p>
<p><img src="images/problem3-1.png" width="780" height="248" alt=""/></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the dialog choose <span class="black-bold">layout</span> from the <span class="black-bold">Resource type</span> dropdown menu, choose <span class="black-bold">Orientation</span> from the <span class="black-bold">Available qualifier's</span> and the press the <span class="black-bold">&gt;&gt;</span> button:</p>
<p><img src="images/problem3-2.png" width="815" height="407" alt=""/></p>
<p>Next ensure that <span class="black-bold">Landscape</span> is selected in the <span class="black-bold">Screen orientation:</span> dropdown menu (this will automatically change the <span class="black-bold">Directory name:</span> to <span class="black-bold">layout-land</span>:</p>
<p><img src="images/problem3-3.png" width="850" height="407" alt=""/></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should now be able to see the two directories (note you need to switch to Project view rather than Android view to see the picture as below.)</p>
<p><img src="images/problem3-4.png" width="343" height="434" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The -land suffix is an example of a configuration qualifier. Android uses qualifiers on res subdirectories to identifiy which resources will best match the current device configuration. Read more about them here: </p>
<p><a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/providing-resources.html">https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/providing-resources.html</a>.</p>
<p class="segment-header">&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<p class="segment-header">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="segment-header">Problem 4)</p>
<p>Now to build a landscape layout start with the existing <span class="code">activity_main.xml</span> layout file. Copy this file and paste a copy into the <span class="code">layout-land</span> subdirectory (Make sure to keep the same file name -they have to accessed with the same resource ID.)</p>
<p><img src="images/problem4-1.png" width="327" height="203" alt=""/></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Now make some layout changes to the <span class="code">activity_main.xml</span> layout file in the <span class="code">layout-land</span> directory. Below I've chosen to put the buttons on the left and the question on the right beside them in landscape orientation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/problem4-2.png" width="219" height="401" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/problem4-3.png" width="390" height="230" alt=""/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/problem4-4.png" width="219" height="401" alt=""/></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now you are both able to handle rotations in you app and also design specific UI layouts that are best suited for portait and landscape orientations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
